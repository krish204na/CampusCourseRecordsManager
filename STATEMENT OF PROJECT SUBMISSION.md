STATEMENT OF PROJECT SUBMISSION

Project Details

* Project Title: Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)
* Project Type: Console-based Java Application
* Primary Goal: To efficiently manage student and course records for an academic institution.
* JDK Version Used: Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 (LTS)
1. Declaration of Originality and Self-Assessment

I, Krishna of 24BCE11005, declare that this submitted work is my own. All source code and documentation within the CampusCourseRecordsManager repository were created by me, demonstrating the required understanding of core Java programming concepts.

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the following key academic and technical requirements:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

The project structure reflects a solid grasp of OOP fundamentals, implemented through classes like:

* Person: Demonstrates Abstraction and Inheritance.
* Student: Demonstrates Polymorphism and Encapsulation.

Modern Java API Utilization

The application incorporates features from modern Java versions, specifically:

* Java 8 Streams: Utilized in methods like CourseService.findCoursesByInstructor for efficient data processing.
* Enums: Used for strict data types in classes like Semester and Grade.
* Assertions: Planned for robust internal testing, requiring the -ea flag for execution.

Design Pattern Implementation

The design adheres to recognized software patterns:

* Builder Pattern: Implemented in the Course.Builder class for creating immutable or complex objects.
* Singleton Pattern: Planned for the AppConfig class to ensure a single instance for configuration management.
1. Fulfillment of Syllabus Topics

The project directly maps to and demonstrates proficiency in the following syllabus topics:

Syllabus Topic

Demonstrated Implementation

Packages

Logical separation of code in edu.ccrm.domain, edu.ccrm.service, etc.

File I/O

Planned implementation using the modern NIO.2 API within ImportExportService.

Exceptions

Custom exceptions, such as MaxCreditLimitExceededException (to be implemented).

JDK, JRE, and JVM

Understanding of the execution environment, with the project developed under the JDK and run on the JVM.

1. Toolchain and Execution Environment

The project was developed using Eclipse IDE and requires JDK 21 to run. The main entry point is the edu.ccrm.cli.CCRMApp class.

1. Final Note

This project represents a significant learning exercise in applying theoretical Java concepts to a practical application. Areas marked as "to be implemented" are identified future development points to complete the full scope of the application's requirements.
